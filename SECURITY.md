## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Healthy System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### üìß How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@healthysystem.com** (or create a private issue if this email is not available)

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### üîí What to Expect

You can expect the following process:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability within 7 days
3. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and aim to release it within 30 days for high/critical issues
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token generation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Owner-based resource access validation
- Password hashing using BCrypt

### Data Protection
- HTTPS/TLS encryption in transit
- Secure database connections
- Environment variable protection
- Input validation and sanitization

### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code analysis with CodeQL
- Secrets scanning with TruffleHog

### Development Security
- Automated security scans in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency updates via Dependabot
- Code review requirements
- Branch protection rules

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Scans
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing with CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Snyk and dotnet security audits
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanner
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog for exposed secrets
- **License Compliance**: Package license validation

### Manual Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Code security reviews
- Infrastructure assessments

## üìã Security Guidelines for Contributors

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, passwords, or API keys
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use secure defaults

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review dependency licenses
- Avoid dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- Use package lock files

### Environment Security
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Separate development and production environments
- Implement proper logging (without sensitive data)
- Use secure communication channels

## üö´ Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This
- Hard-code secrets in source code
- Use default passwords
- Disable security features for convenience
- Trust user input without validation
- Store sensitive data in logs
- Use HTTP in production
- Commit `.env` files with real secrets

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead
- Use secure secret management
- Generate strong, unique passwords
- Enable all security features
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use structured logging without PII
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Use `.env.example` with placeholder values

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure these security-related environment variables are properly configured:

```bash
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-key>
JWT_ISSUER=HealthySystem
JWT_AUDIENCE=HealthySystemUsers
JWT_EXPIRY_MINUTES=60

# Database Security
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=<encrypted-connection>
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-password>

# Application Security
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443
```

### Recommended Security Headers
The application should implement these security headers:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```
